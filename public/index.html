      content="A memory game is a famous game in which a pair of cards are placed in front of a player with their face down. The two pairs are always going to have the same content. The player has the choice to select any two cards at a time and check if the faces of the card match or not. If the face content match then he can keep the images with their face up and continue else the players needs to put them back face down. The game is over when all the pairs have been matched."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
